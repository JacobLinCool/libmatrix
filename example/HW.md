# Programming Homework 1

Matrix Calculator by Jacob Lin.

> Repository: <https://github.com/JacobLinCool/libmatrix>

## The `libmatrix` Library

It is definitely a well-designed matrix library. It is easy to use and well-documented. The code is also well-organized and easy to read. The code is also well-tested.

Some features:

-  Platform Independent
-  Generic by Nature
-  Memory Efficient (Sparse Matrix with Auto-Realloc)
-  Operations: Addition, Multiplication, Hadamard Multiplication, Transpose, Exponentiation, etc.
-  Elegantly Extract Submatrix
-  Transform to/from 1D/2D Array
-  Validation and Auto-fixing of a matrix

You can find the documentation [here](https://jacoblincool.github.io/libmatrix/). It's a doxygen-generated documentation.

## The Matrix Calculator

It is a simple matrix calculator built with my own matrix library `libmatrix`.

It supports macOS and Linux.

```c
#ifdef _WIN32
	fprintf(stderr, "This program is not supported on Windows. :(\n");
	return EXIT_FAILURE;
#endif
```

Some Highlights:

-  Responsive UI
-  Menu Navigation
-  Interactive Editor
-  Interactive Submatrix Extractor
-  Save/Load Matrix to/from File (`.matrices`, `.m`, `.txt`)

It has a good terminal UI. See the demo video for more details: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JacobLinCool/libmatrix/main/example/screenshots/screencast.mp4>

The user interface is responsive to the terminal size and self-explanatory.

You can make a new matrix and edit it in the editor. You can also load a matrix from a file (after you save it to a file).

> You can use `.` and `-` to change edit mode.
> In decimal mode, the reversed edit order is expected, which makes `0` in the middle possible.

![load.png](screenshots/load.png)

> If you load matrices from `m`, it will find `m.matrices`, `m.m`, `m.txt`, `m` in that order.

You can then do some matrix operations.

After every operation, a new result matrix with random name will be created. You can rename it later.

You can also extract a submatrix from a matrix.

## Some Time Complexity Analysis

The following analysis is based on below declaration:

```c
DECLARE_MATRIX(MyMatrix, double, int64_t);
MATRIX(MyMatrix, double, int64_t);
```

`MyMatrix_new` is the constructor of `MyMatrix`. It takes `rows` and `cols` as parameters. It is $O(1)$ since it only allocates a little memory for the first term.

`MyMatrix_free` is the destructor of `MyMatrix`. It takes a pointer to `MyMatrix` as parameter. It is $O(1)$ since it only frees the memory allocated by `MyMatrix_new`.

`MyMatrix_rename` rename a matrix. It takes a pointer to `MyMatrix` and a new name as parameters. It is $O(1)$ since it only frees the old name and allocates a new name.

`MyMatrix_find` finds a term index in a matrix by row and column. It takes a pointer to `MyMatrix`, a row and a column as parameters. It is $O(log(n))$ since it uses binary search to find the term, `n` is the number of terms in the matrix. If it can find the term, it returns `{ true, index }`, otherwise it returns `{ false, index_to_insert }`.

`MyMatrix_set` sets a term in a matrix. It takes a pointer to `MyMatrix`, a row, a column and a value as parameters. It is $O(n)$ since it calls `MyMatrix_find` to find the term and try to keep the order of the terms.

`MyMatrix_get` gets a term in a matrix. It takes a pointer to `MyMatrix`, a row and a column as parameters. It is $O(log(n))$ since it calls `MyMatrix_find` to find the term.

`MyMatrix_transpose` transposes a matrix. It takes a pointer to `MyMatrix` as parameter. It is $O(cols + terms)$ since it pre-computes the number of terms in each column and then iterate through the terms to set the new terms.

`MyMatrix_add` adds two matrices. It takes two pointers to `MyMatrix` as parameters. It is $O(n + m)$, `n` and `m` are the number of terms in the two matrices. It iterates through all the terms in the two matrices. Although it calls `MyMatrix_set` to set the terms, it is $O(1)$ since it does not need to swap the terms because the terms are already sorted.

`MyMatrix_multiply` multiplies two matrices. It takes two pointers to `MyMatrix` as parameters. It is $O((A.terms \times B.cols) + (B.terms \times A.rows))$, $A$ and $B$ are the two matrices. It first transposes $B$, then iterates through all the terms in $A$ and $B_T$, and multiply with each other. Just like `MyMatrix_add`, `MyMatrix_set` at here is $O(1)$.

`MyMatrix_hadamard` multiplies two matrices element-wise. It takes two pointers to `MyMatrix` as parameters. It is $O(n + m)$, `n` and `m` are the number of terms in the two matrices. It iterates through all the terms in the two matrices just like `MyMatrix_add`.

`MyMatrix_exp` exponentiates a matrix. It takes a pointer to `MyMatrix` and an exponent (non-negative integer) as parameters. It is $O(log(exp) \times (terms \times cols))$, `terms` and `cols` are the number of terms and columns in the matrix. It uses binary exponentiation to compute the exponentiation so we get $O(log(exp))$.

`MyMatrix_submatrix` extracts a submatrix from a matrix. It takes a pointer to `MyMatrix`, a boolean array of rows and a boolean array of columns as parameters. It is $O(n)$, `n` is the number of terms in the matrix. It iterates through all the terms in the matrix and check if the corresponding row and column is selected (`true`).
